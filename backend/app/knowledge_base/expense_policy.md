## Audit & Compliance

### Expense Audits

Finance randomly audits 10% of expense reports:

- Confirm business purpose
- Check policy compliance

**If Issues Found:**
- Request clarification or additional documentation
- Reject inappropriate expenses
- Repeated violations → manager coaching or discipline

### Policy Violations

**Examples:**
- Submitting personal expenses as business
- Inflating expense amounts
- Fabricating receipts

**Consequences:**
- Immediate denial of reimbursement
- Repayment required if already reimbursed
- Disciplinary action up to termination
- Possible legal action for fraud

**We Trust You:** This policy assumes good faith. Honest mistakes are OK—intentional abuse is not.

## Tips for Smooth Reimbursement

✅ **Take photos of receipts immediately** (don't wait until they fade or get lost)

✅ **Submit monthly** (don't let expenses pile up)

✅ **Be specific in business purpose** ("Client meeting re: Q4 contract renewal" vs. "Client dinner")

✅ **Pre-approve large expenses** (conference registration, equipment)

✅ **Use corporate card when possible** (easier than fronting cash)

✅ **Separate personal and business** (if mixed trip, only submit business portion)

✅ **Ask finance if unsure** (better to ask before than have it denied)
